# Prisma Vault for Series Development 

The Prisma Vault system is designed to manage series development, from early concepts through production. It handles:
- Series bible and canonical content
- Development and prototype materials
- Production documentation
- Team coordination
- Research and references

Download [Prisma Vault as a zip file](https://github.com/peterkaminski/prisma-vault/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

The file/folder system is designed for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/). For multi-device or teams, you can use Obsidian Sync (paid, easy) or Git (free, a little technical).
