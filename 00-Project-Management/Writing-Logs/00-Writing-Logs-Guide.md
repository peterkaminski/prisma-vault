# Writing Logs Guide

Writing logs provide a structured way to document and track writing activities across individual writers, teams, and AI assistance sessions. They serve as a record of progress, decisions, challenges, and insights throughout the development process.

## Log Types

### Individual Writer Logs
- Filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-[WriterName]-Log.md`
- Focus: Personal progress, ideas, challenges, and questions
- Tags: `#team/writing` `#pm/workflow` `#access/team` `#doc/note`

### Team Writing Logs
- Filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-Team-[TeamName]-Log.md`
- Focus: Collaborative work, shared decisions, and team consensus
- Tags: `#team/writing` `#team/all` `#pm/workflow` `#access/team` `#doc/note`

### AI Assistant Logs
- Filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-AI-[AssistantName]-Log.md`
- Focus: Prompt engineering, generation parameters, and quality assessment
- Tags: `#team/writing` `#pm/workflow` `#type/style` `#doc/note`

## Log Structure

All writing logs should include:

1. **Session Information**
   - Date and duration
   - Writer/team/AI assistant name
   - Focus area/project component

2. **Goals & Objectives**
   - What was planned for this session
   - Target outputs or milestones

3. **Progress Summary**
   - Accomplishments
   - Changes made

6. **Next Steps**
   - Planned follow-up work
   - Tasks for subsequent sessions
   - Areas needing feedback

7. **Links & References**
   - Related documents
   - Research materials
   - Canon references

## AI Assistant Log Special Sections

For AI writing assistance, also include:

1. **Prompt Details**
   - Prompt engineering approach
   - Specific instructions provided
   - Parameters and constraints

2. **Generation Settings**
   - AI model used
   - Temperature/creativity settings
   - Other technical parameters

3. **Output Assessment**
   - Quality evaluation
   - Areas requiring human refinement
   - Successful patterns to repeat

## Integration with Workflow

- Review logs before team meetings to identify discussion points
- Use logs to track progress against milestones and deadlines
- Reference logs when resolving conflicts about creative decisions
- Include log identifiers in commit messages when updating content
